# Ensure Node.js is Installed

# Open your terminal or command prompt.
# Type the following command to check your Node.js version:
node -v

# If you see a version number (e.g., v18.x.x or higher), you're good to go.
# If not, download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org (LTS version recommended).

# Navigate to Your Project Directory

# In the terminal, use cd (change directory) to navigate to your project folder (e.g., Event-Calendar).
# Example:
cd Documents/Event-Calendar

# Install Project Dependencies

# Once in the project directory, run:
npm install
# (Alternatively, if you use Yarn:)
# yarn install

# Set Up Environment Variables (Important for AI Features)

# Open the .env file in the project root (Event-Calendar/.env).
# Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
# Example:
# GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY

# If you don't plan to use the AI features immediately, the app (calendar, event management) will still work,
# but Smart Schedule will likely fail.

# Run the Development Server

# Start the Next.js development server:
npm run dev
# (Or if using Yarn:)
# yarn dev

# Watch for the output indicating the server is ready, typically:
# ‚úì Ready in x.xxs
# ‚óè Next.js 15.x.x
#   Local: http://localhost:9002

# Access the App in Your Browser

# Open your browser and go to:
# http://localhost:9002
# (Port number may vary if 9002 is occupied.)

# Developing AI Features (Optional - Genkit Dev Server)

# Open a new terminal window, navigate to your project directory, and run:
npm run genkit:dev
# Or for auto-reloading on changes to AI files:
npm run genkit:watch

# This runs the Genkit dev server (usually at http://localhost:4000) for developing AI flows.
# The Next.js app will continue to call these flows as server actions.

# That‚Äôs it! Your Eventide Calendar application should now be running locally.
# You can make code changes and the server will auto-reload.
